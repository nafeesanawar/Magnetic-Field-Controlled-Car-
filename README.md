# Magnetic-Field-Controlled-Car-

****What the project is about:****
The project report introduces the Magnetic Field Controlled Robot, an autonomous robot maneuvered via a varying magnetic field. It comprises a PIC32 microcontroller-driven transmitter generating constant-frequency electromagnetic signals, while the receiver, featuring inductive sensors and STM32 microcontroller system, interprets these signals to dictate the robot's movements. The robot operates in track mode, maintaining a 50 cm distance from the transmitter, and command mode, executing forward, backward, left, right, U-turn, stop, and backward left/right movements via magnetic field instructions. Notably, a temperature sensor in the transmitter inductor serves as a safety feature, warning users of overheating.
